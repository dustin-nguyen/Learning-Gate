## Overview
Since online learning has proved its strengths during the COVID-19 pandemic, our team we try to create an online learning website such as Linkedin Learning, Coursera, etc.   

On our website, the instructors can set up courses and put a price on the course, while students can register and pay for the courses with their balance in their accounts. Course materials that the instructor uploaded are only available to the students who have registered. Visitors can only search for courses and read the description of the courses.   

Once a student registers and pays for the course, funds flow from the student's account to the teacher's account. We take 5% from both student's and teacher's accounts as our profit.
## Target Users
Our target users are students and instructors.
## Implementation
### Front-end (Client):
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS (for module 4)
### Backend (Server):
Database: MongoDB
